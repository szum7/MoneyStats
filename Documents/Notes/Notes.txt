> add-migration InitialCreate
Info:
-----
Creates a script to create or update the database based on your current model.

Running it the first time: creates a <current_date>_InitialCreate.cs file with mostly CreateTable commands.

Running it after a model change: creates a <current_date>_<name-you-have-given-it>.cs file with alters, if 
a table needs to change.

Not removing these .cs files will give you a nice history what happened with your DB and when.


> remove-migration
// Running it once will remove the last (?) migration .cs file.
